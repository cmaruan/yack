# YACK: Yet Another C Kernel

Welcome! This is a side project I've been cooking
for so long that now I finally managed to find some
time to implement it. 

YACK is intended for my personal learning of low level system
development, but it could very well be used in teaching. 
I want to aim for a POSIX-like system following some Unix 
phisolophies. If you feel like making a contribuiton, create an issue. 

I shout out to [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public), [linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/). This project was made possible because of them. Thanks!
